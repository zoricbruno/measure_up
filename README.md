# Measure Up

Measure up is a simple Android app used for teaching students about sensors and Android app development basics. The main goal of the app is to be utilised for the Labus exercises, when primary or secondary school students attend Ferit in an attempt to get a glimpse of what how is being taught at the faculty. 

In the future, more sensors are planned and branches created containing exercises.
